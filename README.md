🔋 EV Battery Monitoring Website

A real-time web-based solution for monitoring the internal environment and performance of Electric Vehicle (EV) batteries using live sensor data.
This project was developed as part of a Final Year Engineering Project.

🚗 Project Overview

The EV Battery Monitoring Website is designed to:

Display real-time EV battery sensor data (Temperature, Humidity, Voltage, Current)

Detect early signs of battery faults and abnormal behavior

Provide predictive maintenance alerts using Machine Learning

Improve safety and efficiency of EV battery systems

✨ Features

🌡️ Real-time monitoring of temperature, voltage, current, and humidity

🧠 Anomaly detection using Isolation Forest (Unsupervised ML Algorithm)
